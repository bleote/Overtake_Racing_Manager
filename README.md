Overtake Racing Manager is a game written with Ruby and some JavaScript. Although Ruby isn't a proper game language, I challenged myself to use the OOP in a way that would emulate a game experience.

I believe that gamification can be a positive alternative to make apps more interesting for people that need to work with data. Overtake Racing Manager's focus is pure entertainment, but we can use the "game approach" with many OOP projects, especially when the target-audience are young Millenials and/or Gen-X.
